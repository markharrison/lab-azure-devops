## Prerequisites

The following are required to complete the script:

- Azure Subscription - will use free tier resources so will cost zero  
- Azure Devops organisation ... is free for less than 5 users  
- Visual Studio ... the free community edition will be sufficient  
- The lab script takes the path of a .NET developer and so .NET will need to be installed on desktop - possible to go off script and use alternative languages/frameworks
